# Online-Shopping-Lab

Practicing Object Oriented programming, arrays, conditionals, and loops by creating a shopping cart with various features.

<strong> 1: addToCart() function </strong>


First off, I created an addToCart() function that accepts one argument, the name of an item. 
Then I used that passed-in string to create a new object representing the item. 

The object should consist of one key-value pair in which the key is the item's name and the value is a randomly-generated price: { itemName: itemPrice }. As more items are added, the cart should start to look something like this: [ { "bananas": 17 }, { "pancake batter": 5 }, { "eggs": 49 }].

The price of each item should be a randomly-generated integer between 1 and 100. 

Upon the successful addition of a new item to the cart, the function should print <itemName> has been added to your cart. to the console and then return the updated cart.
